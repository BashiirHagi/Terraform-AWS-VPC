# VPC

Provisoned AWS resources in the us-west-2 (Oregon) Region 

I used a Terraform VPC module to provision common configuration functionalities

I used a multi-AZ deployment and deployed services across separate availability zones to ensure high availability and redundancy

I provisoned a private/public subnets, NAT gateway, security group and a autoscaling group

I hosted my instances inside a autoscaling group to ensure the scalability of my environment
